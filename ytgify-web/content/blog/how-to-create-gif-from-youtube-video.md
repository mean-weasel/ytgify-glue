Creating GIFs from YouTube videos has never been easier. With YTgify, you can turn any moment from a YouTube video into a shareable GIF in under 30 seconds.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have the YTgify extension installed:
- [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ytgify/dnljofakogbecppbkmnoffppkfdmpfje)
- [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ytgify-for-firefox/)

## Step 1: Find Your Video

Navigate to any YouTube video. YTgify works with regular videos, music videos, clips, and more. The only exception is YouTube Shorts, which use a different player format.

## Step 2: Click the GIF Button

Look for the **pink GIF button** below the video, right next to the like/dislike buttons. Click it to open the GIF creator overlay.

## Step 3: Select Your Clip

Use the timeline controls to select the exact portion of the video you want to capture:
- Drag the start and end markers
- Use the preview to see exactly what you'll get
- Maximum clip length is about 10 seconds

## Step 4: Customize Settings

Before creating your GIF, you can adjust:
- **Resolution**: Choose from 360p, 480p, or 720p
- **Frame Rate**: Select 10, 15, or 20 FPS
- **Text Overlay**: Add custom text for memes and captions

## Step 5: Download

Click the download button and your GIF will be saved to your computer. That's it! No watermark, no account required, completely free.

## Pro Tips

- Higher resolution means larger file sizes
- 15 FPS is usually the sweet spot for smooth animation
- Keep clips short for smaller file sizes
- Add text overlays for instant meme creation

Happy GIF making!
