Different social media platforms have different requirements for GIFs. Here's a quick guide to help you create the perfect GIF for any platform.

## Twitter / X

Twitter accepts GIFs up to **15MB** in size. For best results:
- **Resolution**: 480p is usually sufficient
- **Frame Rate**: 15 FPS
- **Duration**: Keep under 5 seconds for auto-play

Twitter will compress your GIF, so starting with slightly higher quality helps maintain clarity.

## Discord

Discord is more generous with GIF support:
- **File Size**: Up to 8MB for standard users, 50MB for Nitro
- **Resolution**: 720p works well
- **Frame Rate**: 15-20 FPS

Discord displays GIFs inline in chat, so make sure the key action is visible even at smaller sizes.

## Reddit

Reddit supports GIFs in comments and posts:
- **File Size**: Varies by subreddit, but 20MB is a safe limit
- **Resolution**: 480p-720p
- **Frame Rate**: 15 FPS

Many subreddits actually prefer video links over GIFs for better quality playback.

## Slack

Slack automatically plays GIFs:
- **File Size**: Up to 50MB
- **Resolution**: 480p is plenty for chat
- **Frame Rate**: 10-15 FPS

Keep in mind that large GIFs can slow down Slack performance.

## General Tips

| Platform | Max Size | Best Resolution | Best FPS |
|----------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Twitter  | 15MB     | 480p            | 15       |
| Discord  | 8-50MB   | 720p            | 15-20    |
| Reddit   | ~20MB    | 480-720p        | 15       |
| Slack    | 50MB     | 480p            | 10-15    |

## Quick Settings Guide

For a GIF that works everywhere:
- **Resolution**: 480p
- **Frame Rate**: 15 FPS
- **Duration**: 3-5 seconds

This combination gives you a good balance of quality and file size that will work on virtually any platform.

Remember: shorter clips with fewer frames = smaller file sizes!
