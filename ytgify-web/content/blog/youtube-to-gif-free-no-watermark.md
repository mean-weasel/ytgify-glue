Looking for a way to create GIFs from YouTube videos without watermarks or hidden fees? YTgify is completely free and adds no watermark to your GIFs.

## Why YTgify?

Most GIF makers either:
- Add a watermark
- Require you to create an account
- Upload your video to their servers
- Limit you to low quality output
- Require payment for basic features

YTgify does none of these things. It's a browser extension that works directly inside YouTube, creating your GIFs locally on your computer.

## How It Works

1. Install the free extension for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ytgify/dnljofakogbecppbkmnoffppkfdmpfje) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ytgify-for-firefox/)
2. Go to any YouTube video
3. Click the pink GIF button
4. Select your clip
5. Download your watermark-free GIF

That's it. No account creation, no uploads, no subscriptions.

## Features Included Free

Everything is free:
- **Multiple resolutions** (360p, 480p, 720p)
- **Adjustable frame rate** (10, 15, 20 FPS)
- **Custom text overlays** for memes
- **No watermark** ever
- **No file size limits**
- **No signup required**

## Privacy First

YTgify processes everything locally in your browser. Your videos are never uploaded to any server. We don't track what you watch or what GIFs you create.
